 SQL. The website is designed to cater to two primary user roles: buyers and administrators.
 
 -Customers Interface: 
 This website allow customers register account to save their information include name, phone number, address, etc, which serve for creating
 orders. Beside, the password will be encrypted for enhancing security. Customers can browse and search for computers and laptops, view
 detailed product information, add items to the shopping cart, and complete purchases securely through an integrated payment system VNPay.
 
 -Administrator Interface :
 Administrators have access to a dedicated management portal where they can add, update, or remove products, brands, categories, post
 sale news; manage staff, and view sales reports. The backend is equipped with robust authentication and authorization mechanisms to
 ensure data security and integrity.
 
 The combination of these technologies ensures a robust, efficient, and scalable platform capable of handling the needs of both buyers and
 administrators while maintaining a high level of performance and security
